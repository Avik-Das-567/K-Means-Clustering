## What is K-Means Clustering?
* K-Means is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**.
* It groups **similar data points** together into **K clusters**.
* We just tell the machine: "**Make K groups**", and it figures out the best way.
## Objective
* We are arranging students into **3 study groups** based on their marks in Math and Science. K-Means will group similar students together based on scores.
* We want to **group them into 3 clusters**.
## How It Works
* Choose how many groups we want (K).
* It places K points (centers).
* Assigns each data point to the **nearest center**.
* Moves the center to the **middle of the group**.
* Repeats until it stabilizes.
